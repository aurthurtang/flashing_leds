# Flashing LEDs


> This is my first FPGA project on the NEXYS A7.  The purpose of this project is to get familiar with the FPGA and Vivado.
> This project will demonstrate the use of the FPGA board to turn on the LEDs on the board.  There are total of 16 LEDs and
> the code will trigger one LED to be on for a given time and then cycle to the next one and so forth.  Once it reaches the 
> last LED, it will cycle through again.

# Requirements

> - Vivado (I'm using Vivado 2020.2)  *Any version should do*
> - Nexys A7 board

# Before getting start

> 1. Download Vivado
> 2. Get the board file from [this link](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/archive/master.zip?_ga=2.208193810.1843468524.1627578007-919375833.1627165649)
